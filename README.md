This is a template for new projects.

It requires a working python3.6 installation and tox (`pip3 install tox`)
to be run. Other versions need changes in the `run.bat` and the `tox.ini`
script.

Run the `run.bat` script. All generated documents will be in the `artifacts/`
folder.  Edit the generated xlsx document and copy it to the `import` folder.
Then run it again to process the changes. The generated requirements document
is now also in the `artifacts/` folder.

This template has no HTML outputs.
